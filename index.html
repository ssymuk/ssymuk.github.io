									<p><b>Each roundtable will run for 45 mins, will be group focused and centred around sharing the Mahima and experience of the respective topic, with others who share a common interest in the same theme.</b></p>
									<p><b>Please select your <em>TOP 4</em> round table topics from the list below and submit them alongside the registration form.</b></p>

										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major"><b>The Secret Blessing</b> (Gurumantra)</h3>
											<p>This roundtable will focus on not just the basics of what the Gurumantra is but more so, the mentality and personal levels one should have before they obtain the Gurumantra. This session will also touch on the implications & daily routine(s) one must follow after taking the Gurumantra. The power and status one achieves from the Gurumantra, as well as its origins and the purpose for Bhagwan Swaminarayan to establish this legacy will also be touched on. You either have it or you don’t, hence it is a secret blessing that will open up doors if done in the right way.</p>

											<h3 class="major"><b>Mind like a Monkey</b> (Dhyaan/Maansi)</h3>
											<p>In our everyday lives we think about everything and anything. 1000s of thoughts go through our mind every minute and Maharaj says the mind is like a monkey, it has traits of never sitting in one place. This roundtable will help share methods in how to focus more on Bhagwan, in particular by doing Dhyaan of His Divine Murti and the benefits and peace one can derive. Coupled with this is the art of Maansi pooja – Your personal love connection with the Almighty. It is a whole new world where you can extend the boundaries as much as you like. All about making the time in this case. Taking small steps now in thinking about Maharaj more = a totally different sense of happiness in the future</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major"><b>The Day-Night One Day International</b> (Chesta)
											</h3>
											<p>The importance of doing satsang in the evening is we burn away any sins committed knowingly or unknowingly during the day. At home or at Mandir, on the train home or just before we go to sleep, remembering the Lord & his Divine charitras opens up the path to achieving Greatness. This roundtable will focus on the mindset and peace gained when singing the kirtans within the Chesta. After a long tiring day, we can always find time to go out, play football or watch a movie but to take 15 mins out & sing a kirtan or two from the Chesta, takes an inner strength with rewards like no other.</p>

											<h3 class="major"><b>The Key to the Greatest Lock</b> (Sant Samaagam)</h3>
											<p>Akshardham...Our biggest target! ...and to unlock your door to Dham, Maharaj has gifted the key to His beloved Santos. Since the beginning of time, true Santos have guided countless amounts of souls in attaining Bhagwan’s sukh. The scriptures countlessly state ‘Bhagwan and His Santos to be Kalyankaari’, and this roundtable will focus on the true impact such a Satpurush can have by merely being in their association. Their love and blessings can positively change our lives in an instant, thus Bhagwan has named them to be our true spiritual mothers. Unlock your true potential.</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major"><b>Get out of Jail Free Card</b> (Ekadashi)</h3>
											<p>Twice a month we are given a time to clean our sin slate clean and also top up our accounts immensely, with the currency that matters the most – punya. Ekadashi is a 15 day alarm clock buzzer to alert us in connecting ourselves to Bhagwan more and to the world around us less. It is way more than chips and chevdo. By itself, Ekadashi has the power to bring Akshardham at your fingertips and release you from the prison of life & death. With such an important lifeline given to us so frequently, this roundtable will discuss how one can truly make the most of this special day.</p>

											<h3 class="major"><b>Mes Que Un Word</b> (Swaminarayan Mahamantra)</h3>
											<p>To some it is just a word, to those who have attained Bhagwan, it is the sole purpose for making the most of this human life….what are we referring to? Swaminarayan. In the past people were not educated like we are today, most couldn’t read or write and very few could deliver talks. However one thing they knew was to chant ‘Swaminarayan’. With every breath, every step and every action it was this very chanting of Swaminarayan that elevated their lives & soul to the upmost level, such is the power of the Lord’s name. This roundtable will share with you how simple it is to live a life for our Lord Swaminarayan, for it is us who complicates it in the first place.</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major"><b>The Life Jacket</b> (Dharma)</h3>
											<p>Bhagwan Shree Swaminarayan emphasised the importance of Dharma in one’s life more than anything else. With Dharma comes Bhakti, husband and wife, hand in hand. The Vachnamrut states ‘a person without Dharma, is like crossing a sea with a heavy rock on your head, you will definitely drown’. Thus Dharma is our life jacket, have Dharma in our lives and with it comes the foundations to truly please Maharaj. Yet in today’s Satsang, we may not give it as much emphasis as we do with other areas. This roundtable will give further insight into the power of Dharma and share experiences to how we can apply small changes to better our lives even further. </p>
